# Final-Project-Tableau
Overview

This project aims to explore and utilize data Visualization and Dashboards with Tableau for comprehensive data analysis. The project seeks to reach into various types of ways to derive actionable insights from data. It uses the data provided in this case AirBnB with listings in New York City to generate how customers use their products and analysizes the capacity to gain an accurate and deep understanding on why these choices are made.



## Project/Goals

Demonstration Expertise

This will enable me to show proficiency in the use of tableau features, best practices and effective dashboard design principles


Insights 

To use Tableau to showcase compelling data visualization by selecting appropraite chart types and organizing data


Enable Decision making

Using this tableau to present findings to indentify trends, correlations, outliers or patterns that can inform decision-making accross various functions and levels  within an organization.


Enhance Communication

Use the information provided to present information in a clear, concise and visually appealing manner to facilitate understanding and drive informed action.



**Process**


1. Data Preparation
   

   Imported the dataset into Tableau, which includes the name of the airbnb, the property type, room type, beds, price and other relevant data.


2. Data exploration
   

   Explored the data to view the details provided by using data source provided in Tableau.


3. Creating data visualization
   

   Used charts, graphs, maps to present data retrieved and prepared to showcase this information on tableau.






## Results



The results from this project showed how data was connected by using different data types.



1. Show the neighbourhood, combined with the zipcode with the highest prices 


   One of the worksheet contained the Map data visuals by combining price, zipcode and neighbourhood.
   This map was chosen to showcase the geographical location of this data, by showing the location Map visuals 
   will enable users to zoom in and out of the location, The color code used from red to green, with red showing 
   the lower end of the price and green showing the higher end of the price. Choosing map also makes the data 
   visualing appealing and enables them to see the New York City locations of the AirBnB at a glance.

2. Using Line graph was another way to showcase this data, this combined the AirBnB hosts since 2009, the top X 
   customers and their price range, this chart enabled the data to show that the highest price point was in 2014, 
   it also showed the trend of rentals from the different hosts. This line graph can also be used to project 
   future trends thereby making informed decisions based on predicitive analytics because it combines three data 
   types.

3. Use the trend of past number of beds and price to forecast the trend with scatter plot to show that where clients will rent airbnb in the future as that has been the      trend in past as the concentration is in the lefthand corner of the chart.

5. In comparing the data set and identifying outliers, a box plot was used to show the concentration of rentals across room type and prices.

6. A bar chart was used to show how number of rooms compared to prices, some rooms rented for less and some rooms rented for more,
   which showed that the price was not a determining factor when it compared to number of rooms rented.

## Challenges 


 1. Some of the challenges faced included having to deals with missing data, which would affect the accuracy of the data provided, and would require extensive cleaning 
    and preprocessing before visualization can occur.

    

 2. Determing profit was difficult as no data showing cost was provided so therefore,
    comparison could not be made as to the profitability of a unit available for rent.

    

 3. Deciding on which visualtion was the most suitable to present the information in a very easy to understand manner.
   
## Future Goals



Clean up the data more and ensure that it more accurate to present to the required audience.


Use other wasys to combine the data presented to give more insights into the provided data.
