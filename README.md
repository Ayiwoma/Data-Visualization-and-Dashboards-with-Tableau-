# Final-Project-Tableau
Overview

This project aims to explore and utilize data Visualization and Dashboards with Tableau for comprehensive data analysis. The project seeks to reach into various types of ways to derive actionable insights from data. It uses the data provided in this case AirBnB with listings in New York City to generate how customers use their products and analysizes the capacity to gain an accurate and deep understanding on why these choices are made.



## Project/Goals

Demonstration of visuals

This program enables the use of tableau features, best practices and effective dashboard design principles.


Insights 

To use Tableau to showcase compelling data visualization by selecting appropriate chart types and organizing data.



Enable Decision making

Using this tableau to present findings to indentify trends, correlations, outliers or patterns that can inform decision-making accross various functions and levels  within an organization.


Enhance Communication

Use the information provided to present information in a clear, concise and visually appealing manner to facilitate understanding and drive informed action.



**Process**


1. Data Preparation
   

   Imported the dataset into Tableau, which includes the name of the airbnb, the property type, room type, beds, 
   price and other relevant data.


2. Data exploration
   

   Explored the data to view the details provided by using data source provided in Tableau.


3. Creating data visualization
   

   Used charts, graphs, maps to present data retrieved and prepared to showcase this information on tableau.






## Results



The results from this project showed how data was connected by using different data types.



1. Show the neighbourhood, combined with the zipcode with the highest prices 


   One of the worksheet contained the Map data visuals by combining price, zipcode and neighbourhood.
   This map was chosen to showcase the geographical location of this data, by showing the location Map visuals 
   will enable users to zoom in and out of the location, The color code used from red to green, with red showing 
   the lower end of the price and green showing the higher end of the price, Although green shows the higher 
   price, there might be other factors in place to limit just focusing on locations with the highest price. 
   Choosing map also makes the data visualing appealing and enables them to see the New York City hotspots of the 
   AirBnB at a glance.

2. Using Line graph was another way to showcase this data, this combined the AirBnB hosts since 2009, the top X 
   customers and their price range, this chart enabled the data to show that the highest price point was in 2014, 
   it also showed the trend of rentals from the different hosts. This line graph can also be used to project 
   future trends thereby making informed decisions based on predicitive analytics because it combines three data 
   types.

3. Use the trend of past number of beds and price to forecast the trend with scatter plot to show that where 
   clients will rent airbnb in the future as that has been the trend in past as the concentration is in the 
   lefthand corner of the chart.

4. In comparing the data set and identifying outliers, a box plot was used to show the concentration of rentals 
   across room type and prices. This chart showcased the median price range for each property type and room type,
   while also showing the outliers for prices that are out of range. The observation noticed here is that the 
   property type that were the outliers, had some unique features some of which villa and private room. Using        this box plot also showed both the upper whisker, upper hinge and lower whisker, lower hinge indicating the 
   interquartile range across the data excluding the outliers.

5. A bar chart was used to showcase how number of rooms compared to prices, some rooms rented for less and some 
   rooms rented for more, which showed that the price was not a determining factor when it compared to count of 
   rooms rented. The insight from this type of chart showed that the product determined the price in this case 
   the product is the room type. This bar chart shows comparison between categories across room types and 
   property types, recommendation given will be that investing in the types that provide the most revenue.

## Challenges 


 1. Some of the challenges faced included having to deals with missing data, which would affect the accuracy of 
    the data provided, and would require extensive cleaning and preprocessing before visualization can occur. Some
    of the missing data included zip codes and host names. Therefore the data shown included only the available 
    data.

    

 2. Determing profit was difficult as no data showing cost was provided so therefore comparison could not be made 
    as to the profitability of a unit available for rent.

    

 3. Deciding on which visualtion was the most suitable to present the information in a very easy to understand 
    manner, that will best convey the information to the user.
   
## Future Goals



   Clean up the data more and ensure that it more accurate to present to the required audience.


   Use other wasys to combine the data presented to give more insights into the provided data.
